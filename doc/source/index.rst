Welcome to Nova's documentation!
================================

Nova is a cloud computing fabric controller, the main part of an IaaS system. 

Nova is written with the following design guidelines in mind:

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault-Tollerant**: Isloated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open Standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Nova and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_.
