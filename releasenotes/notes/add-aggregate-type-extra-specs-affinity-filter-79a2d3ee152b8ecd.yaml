features:
  - Add a new scheduler filter, AggregateTypeExtraSpecsAffinityFilter, which
    filters only hosts aggregated inside host aggregates containing
    "flavor_extra_spec" metadata. Keys inside this variable must match with the
    instance extra specs. The entries in the list will be separated by commas
    without white space. Each entry will comprise of an instance type extra
    spec key followed by an equals "=" followed by a value (<key>=<value>).
    Documentation can be find in doc folder (doc/source/filter_scheduler.rst)
    and online (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/filter_scheduler.html).
